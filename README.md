Here's a fun program I wrote out of boredom:

get random curses that folks used back in 1800's!

and while you're at it, you can learn some multithreading in java too (if u give a $hit).

here's how to run it:

1-have linux (bc I didn't want to use maven or any other tools for a fun program)

2-chmod +x *.sh

3-./compile.sh && ./run.sh

4-hit CTRL+C to end the program
